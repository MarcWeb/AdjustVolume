AdjustVolume
============

AdjustVolume is an Android app that I created to demonstrate the different ways by which you can interact with the AudioManger features of Android. The app currently supports the following features.

*   Increase Volume
*   Decrease Volume
*   Play next Song
*   Play previous Song
*   Get the trackname of the currently playing song

Please note that the app currently works on HTC mobiles and other the default music player in other mobiles.
